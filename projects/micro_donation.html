                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Millennial grocery shoppers, who are interested to donate to charities, often feel pressured when asked to donate by cashiers at the checkout counters and find the information given to them about the charity insufficient.</p>
            </aside>
            <aside class="aside aside-2">
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>A portable kiosk from which customers could acquire knowledge on the charity and make donations without human pressure. The kiosk is designed to print out a slip for convenient payment of donation along with other groceries bought.</p>

                        <p> Charity organizations, which are important stakeholders, can collect a considerable amount of donations through micro-donation in grocery stores, 
                            and many grocery stores today participate in charity fundraising.
                            Concerning millennial shoppers, our target audience, current trends indicate that they are likely to make micro-donations in grocery stores. However, they undergo a complex decision-making process before making a donation. Considerations include the credibility of the charity, urgency of the situation, ease of making a donation, and availability of funds.</p>

                            1. A kiosk placed in an aisle related to the charity from which customers could acquire knowledge on the charity and make donation decisions.
                            2. A web app which allows users to explore the world of donation receivers in augmented reality and make a donation decision. Users would access the web app through QR codes placed on posters.
                            3. Expand the capability of kiosks at checkout counters so that allows users can learn more about the charities and initiate the act of donation. As groceries are checked out, charity related to the items will appear on screen.</p>

                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p>The final design is a kiosk placed in the aisles which displays a video related to the charity stakeholders to draws usersâ€™ attention and encourage interaction.
                            Using the kiosk, users would learn about the background story, number of donors, and the impact they can make. 
                            For convenience of payment, the kiosk will print out a barcode which can then be scanned and paid along with other items bought at the checkout counters.
                            The solution received a SUS score of 82, which is much higher than the average SUS score of 68, indicating the success of the design.

                        <p><strong>Team size: 4</strong>. Throughout the project, the team met often to brainstorm ideas and discuss designs and research methods. I had been one of the more <strong>active contributors</strong> in team discussions and often <strong>guided the team</strong> to reach conclusions/resolutions. The <strong>organizer</strong> and <strong>analyzer</strong> were two unique roles I played on the team. Teammates have entrusted me with the tasks of <strong>outlining research plans</strong>, <strong>analyzing research findings</strong>, and the <strong>final review</strong> of our work reports.</p>
